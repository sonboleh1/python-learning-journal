A repository to document my Python learning journey



About Me:
    My name is Sonboleh.  I am a Test engineer and I use python daily.  I am working on expanding my knowledge of python and to learn more about concepts.

    
Goals for This Course:
    Learn more about data structure and more efficient coding.

    
My First Python Program (include a simple "Hello, World!" program in a code block):
```
def greeting():
    print("HELLO, WORLD!!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greeting()
```

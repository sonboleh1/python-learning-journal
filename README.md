# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey



About Me:
    My name is Sonboleh.  I am a Test engineer and I use python daily.  I am taking a course at West Vally in Saratoga, CA.  I am working on expanding my knowledge of python and to learn more about programming concepts.  In this repository, I will add all my homework from this class.  I expect my homework to include data structures and more.  Stay Tuned!

    
Goals for This Course:
    Learn more about data structure, linked lists, trees, and more efficient coding.  

    
My First Python Program:

'''
def greeting():
    print("HELLO, WORLD!!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greeting()
'''
